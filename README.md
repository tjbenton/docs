Docs, adapts to any language and will help you document all the things.Where there is development there is a need for documentation. There are several great libraries for all sorts of files, written by brilliant developers, libraries like [SassDoc][sass-doc], [JSDoc][js-doc], [JavaDoc][java-doc], [Jazzy][jazzy], [StyleDocco][styledocco], [KSS][kss], [Hologram][hologram], [DSS][dss] and several more. All of these libraries do a very good job for documenting their respective languages. However there are very few projects that suport more than 1 language. Which means if you really want to document all your code you may have to use 3 or 4 of these documentation generators. Each of the generators have their own way of documenting and their annotations, and their own document site which just makes it harder to keep all your documentation in one spot.

Docs fixes all these issues by giving you the ability to generate documentation for all your files. While giving you control over what annotations you want to use in each file type.
